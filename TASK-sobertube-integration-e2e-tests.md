- [ ] Update Jest configuration to handle new directory structure

## Phase 1: Integration Tests - Authentication Flows

### 1.0.0 User Registration and Login Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Complete registration flow (register → verify created in DB → login → access protected route)
- [ ] **Test**: Registration validation chain (invalid data → proper error responses → valid data → success)
- [ ] **Test**: Duplicate user prevention (email and username uniqueness across auth and users tables)
- [ ] **Test**: Password security requirements and hashing integration

### 1.0.1 Authentication Token Management Integration  
- [ ] **Test**: Token lifecycle (login → get token → use token → refresh token → use refreshed token)
- [ ] **Test**: Token expiration and refresh flow (expired token → refresh → new valid token)
- [ ] **Test**: Invalid token handling (malformed token → 401, expired without refresh → 401)
- [ ] **Test**: Concurrent token refresh requests (multiple simultaneous refresh attempts)

### 1.0.2 Protected Routes Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Auth middleware integration (no token → 401, valid token → success, invalid token → 401)
- [ ] **Test**: Optional auth middleware (no token → public access, valid token → authenticated access)
- [ ] **Test**: User context injection (authenticated request → req.user populated correctly)

## Phase 2: Integration Tests - Profile Management Flows

### 2.0.0 Profile Creation and Auth Integration
- [ ] **Test**: End-to-end profile creation (register → login → create profile → profile linked to auth user)
- [ ] **Test**: Profile creation validation (missing fields → errors, valid data → success)
- [ ] **Test**: Profile-auth relationship (profile creation updates users table with auth user ID)
- [ ] **Test**: Duplicate profile prevention (user can only have one profile)

### 2.0.1 Profile Privacy and Access Control Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Profile privacy levels (public → accessible to all, private → owner only, friends → friends only)
- [ ] **Test**: Profile update permissions (owner can update, others cannot)
- [ ] **Test**: Profile access validation (correct user context checking for privacy controls)

### 2.0.2 Profile Data Management Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Profile CRUD operations with auth (create → read → update → verify changes)
- [ ] **Test**: Profile data validation and sanitization (XSS prevention, input validation)
- [ ] **Test**: Profile data consistency (updates reflected immediately in reads)

## Phase 3: Integration Tests - Posts System Flows

### 3.0.0 Posts Creation and Authentication Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Authenticated post creation (login → create post → post linked to user)
- [ ] **Test**: Post creation validation (content validation, type validation, image URL validation)
- [ ] **Test**: Unauthenticated post creation prevention (no token → 401 error)
- [ ] **Test**: Post ownership assignment (created post has correct user_id)

### 3.0.1 Posts CRUD with Authorization Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Post update authorization (owner can update, others get 403)
- [ ] **Test**: Post deletion authorization (owner can delete, others get 403)
- [ ] **Test**: Post retrieval with user data (posts include correct user profile information)
- [ ] **Test**: Post ownership validation (user can only modify their own posts)

### 3.0.2 Posts Feed and Filtering Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Posts feed with pagination (multiple pages, correct pagination metadata)
- [ ] **Test**: Posts filtering by type (filter works correctly, returns only specified types)
- [ ] **Test**: Posts ordering (newest first, correct chronological order)
- [ ] **Test**: Posts with user profile data (feed includes username, display_name, profile_picture_url)

## Phase 4: Cross-Feature Integration Tests

### 4.0.0 Complete User Onboarding Flow Integration
- [ ] **Test**: Full user journey (register → login → create profile → create first post → view in feed)
- [ ] **Test**: User data consistency across features (profile info appears correctly in posts)
- [ ] **Test**: Multi-step transaction integrity (partial failures don't corrupt data)

### 4.0.1 User Interaction and Data Relationships
- [ ] **Test**: Multiple users interaction (User A creates post → User B views in feed with correct profile data)
- [ ] **Test**: User profile updates reflect in posts (profile change → posts show updated user info)
- [ ] **Test**: Data cascade behavior (consider user deletion impacts on posts and profiles)

### 4.0.2 Error Handling Across Features
- [ ] **Test**: Database connection failures during multi-feature operations
- [ ] **Test**: Partial operation failures and rollback behavior
- [ ] **Test**: Error consistency across all feature integrations

## Phase 5: End-to-End User Journey Tests

  - Verify account created in database
  - Login with credentials and receive tokens
  - Create user profile with bio and settings
  - Create first recovery post
  - View post in public feed
  - Verify all data relationships are correct

### 5.0.1 Multi-User Social Interaction E2E
- [ ] **E2E Test**: Multi-User Community Interaction
  - User A: Register → Create profile → Create public post
  - User B: Register → Create profile → View User A's post in feed
  - User B: Create response or related post
  - Verify both users' posts appear correctly in feed
  - Test profile privacy interactions

### 5.0.2 Privacy and Security E2E Flows

## Implementation Notes

- All tests should follow TDD principles and existing test patterns
- Use factory functions for test data creation to avoid hardcoded values
- Ensure proper test cleanup to prevent cross-test pollution
- Integration tests should test real database interactions, not mocks
- E2E tests should simulate complete user workflows without shortcuts
- Maintain existing test helper patterns and extend them consistently
- Ensure all tests work with the existing Supabase test configuration
