# TASK: Video CRUD Operations Implementation (1.3.0)

## Overview
Implement comprehensive video CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations API endpoints to complete the Video Upload & Management System. This builds on the existing video upload, validation, and metadata systems.

## Current Status
- ✅ Video File Validation (1.1.3) - Complete
- ✅ Video Upload with Progress Tracking (1.2.0) - Complete  
- ✅ Video Storage Infrastructure - Complete (Supabase buckets, policies)
- ✅ Video Metadata Management Service - Complete
- ✅ Database Schema - Complete (videos table with RLS policies)

## Phase 1: Public Video API Endpoints
Focus: Implement the core public-facing video CRUD operations

### 1.3.1 Video Listing and Retrieval Endpoints ⭐ **NEXT SUB-FEATURE**
- [ ] **1.3.1.1** Add GET /api/videos endpoint (public - list all ready videos with pagination)
- [ ] **1.3.1.2** Add GET /api/videos/:id endpoint (public - get single video details)
- [ ] **1.3.1.3** Add GET /api/videos/user/:userId endpoint (public - get user's videos)
- [ ] **1.3.1.4** Add GET /api/videos/my-videos endpoint (protected - user's own videos with all statuses)
- [ ] **1.3.1.5** Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering query parameters
- [ ] **1.3.1.6** Add video view count increment functionality
- [ ] **1.3.1.7** Create comprehensive tests for all video retrieval endpoints

### 1.3.2 Video Update Operations
- [ ] **1.3.2.1** Add PUT /api/videos/:id endpoint (protected - update video metadata)
- [ ] **1.3.2.2** Add PATCH /api/videos/:id/status endpoint (protected - update video status)
- [ ] **1.3.2.3** Implement video ownership validation for updates
- [ ] **1.3.2.4** Add video engagement endpoints (likes/unlikes)
- [ ] **1.3.2.5** Create comprehensive tests for video update operations

### 1.3.3 Video Deletion Operations
- [ ] **1.3.3.1** Add DELETE /api/videos/:id endpoint (protected - soft delete video)
- [ ] **1.3.3.2** Implement cascade deletion for storage files
- [ ] **1.3.3.3** Add video ownership validation for deletion
- [ ] **1.3.3.4** Create comprehensive tests for video deletion operations

## Phase 2: Advanced Video Features
Focus: Enhance video system with advanced functionality

### 1.3.4 Video Search and Discovery
- [ ] **1.3.4.1** Add GET /api/videos/search endpoint with text search
- [ ] **1.3.4.2** Implement video filtering by duration, format, date
- [ ] **1.3.4.3** Add video recommendations based on user activity
- [ ] **1.3.4.4** Create comprehensive tests for search functionality

### 1.3.5 Video Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] **1.3.5.1** Add GET /api/videos/:id/analytics endpoint (owner only)
- [ ] **1.3.5.2** Implement video performance metrics tracking
- [ ] **1.3.5.3** Add user video statistics dashboard endpoint
- [ ] **1.3.5.4** Create comprehensive tests for analytics endpoints

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Requirements
- **Follow TDD Methodology**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
- **Use Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage VideoMetadataService and existing validation
- **Maintain Security**: Implement proper authorization and RLS policies
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing and pagination

### Code Integration Points
- **Controllers**: Extend backend/src/controllers/videos.ts with new endpoints
- **Routes**: Update backend/src/routes/videos.ts with new route definitions
- **Services**: Utilize existing VideoMetadataService for database operations
- **Tests**: Create comprehensive test suites in backend/tests/

### Quality Gates
- All endpoints must have corresponding unit and integration tests
- API responses must follow consistent JSON structure
- All database queries must be optimized with proper indexing
- Security policies must be validated for each endpoint
- Error scenarios must be properly handled and tested

## Dependencies
- ✅ Video Upload System (1.2.0) - Required for video creation flow
- ✅ Video Metadata Service - Required for all CRUD operations
- ✅ Authentication System - Required for protected endpoints
- ✅ Database Schema - Required for video table operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All video CRUD endpoints are implemented and tested
- [ ] Video listing supports pagination, sorting, and filtering
- [ ] Video ownership and permissions are properly enforced
- [ ] API follows RESTful conventions and returns consistent responses
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) for all new endpoints
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for video listing queries
- [ ] Integration with existing video upload and validation systems
- [ ] Documentation updated with new API endpoints

## Next Action
**START WITH SUB-FEATURE 1.3.1**: Video Listing and Retrieval Endpoints
This is the most logical starting point as it builds on existing metadata service capabilities and provides essential functionality for video consumption.
