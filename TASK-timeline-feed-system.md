## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

This timeline/feed system is the cornerstone of the SoberTube user experience. It brings together all previously implemented systems (auth, profiles, posts, videos) into a cohesive, engaging platform where users can discover, interact with, and create recovery-focused content.

The implementation follows strict TDD methodology with comprehensive testing at each phase. Each sub-feature must be fully tested and validated before proceeding to the next.

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**
1. Real-time updates must work flawlessly
2. Video playback must be smooth and reliable
3. Feed performance must scale with content volume
4. Mobile experience must be exceptional
5. All interactions must feel instant and responsive

**RISK MITIGATION:**
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use progressive enhancement for video features
- Add fallback mechanisms for real-time features
- Plan for content moderation integration
- Design for future scalability requirements
