## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Schema (Already Complete):
- **Follows Table**: `follows` table with user relationships
- **Proper Constraints**: Foreign keys, unique constraints, cascade deletes
- **Indexes**: Optimized for follow relationship queries
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security for follow operations

### API Endpoint Structure:
**Follows Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/follows` - Body: `{following_id: string}` (toggle follow/unfollow)
- `GET /api/follows/status?user_id=xxx` - Check if current user follows specified user
- `GET /api/follows/following?limit=10&cursor=xxx` - List who user follows
- `GET /api/follows/followers?limit=10&cursor=xxx` - List user's followers

### Integration Points:
1. **Feed Integration**: Update unified feed to prioritize followed users' content
