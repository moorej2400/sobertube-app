# TASK: SoberTube Fix Compilation Issues and Continue Implementation

## Project Context
- **Repository**: /home/jared/dev/personal/sobertube-app

- [ ] **2.3.4**: Register posts routes in main app router

#### 2.4 Posts API Testing
- [ ] **2.4.0**: Write integration tests for post creation endpoint
- [ ] **2.4.1**: Create tests for post retrieval with pagination
- [ ] **2.4.2**: Add tests for post update with authorization checks
- [ ] **2.4.3**: Implement tests for post deletion with ownership validation
- [ ] **2.4.4**: Add tests for post validation and error handling

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 0 Requirements (Compilation Fix)
- TypeScript must compile successfully to dist directory
- All build artifacts must be generated (source maps, declarations)
- Build process must work consistently in development and test environments
- All dependencies must be properly installed and configured
- Test environment must be able to build and run tests

### Authentication System Requirements
- Username uniqueness must be enforced at database and application level
- Rate limiting must use in-memory store with proper cleanup for MVP
- Refresh tokens must be securely stored and rotated
- All authentication endpoints must have comprehensive error handling

### Posts System Requirements  
- Posts table must support text content, post types, and metadata
- All post endpoints must have proper authorization
- Post content must be validated and sanitized
- Pagination must be efficient with offset-based approach for MVP
- Error handling must be comprehensive

### Testing Requirements
- All compilation tests must pass
- All endpoints must have integration tests with real database calls
- Authentication must be tested with valid JWT tokens
- Error scenarios must be comprehensively tested
- Database constraints must be tested (uniqueness, foreign keys)

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 Complete When:
- [ ] TypeScript compiles successfully with no errors
- [ ] dist directory is generated with all artifacts
- [ ] All compilation tests pass
- [ ] Test environment runs without build errors
- [ ] Full test suite can execute (even if some tests fail)

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All authentication tests pass
- [ ] Username duplicates are properly rejected with 409 status
- [ ] Rate limiting works with 429 status codes after threshold
- [ ] Refresh token functionality works correctly
- [ ] No compilation or build errors in authentication system

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] Posts table exists with proper schema and constraints
- [ ] All CRUD operations work for posts with proper authorization
- [ ] Post validation enforces character limits and required fields
- [ ] Pagination works for post retrieval
- [ ] All posts integration tests pass
- [ ] Posts API properly handles all error scenarios

## Critical Instructions for Sub-Agents

### Environment Context
- Running in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Ubuntu
- ALWAYS use desktop commander MCP tools for docker and curl operations
- Follow TDD methodology strictly
- Each sub-feature must be fully tested before proceeding to next

### Agent Assignment Rules
- Launch CODER-AGENT for all TypeScript/Node.js development work
- Launch WORKER-AGENT for system administration, file operations, docker tasks
- Only assign ONE sub-feature at a time to each agent
- Wait for agent completion before proceeding to next sub-feature
- Use VALIDATOR-AGENT after each feature (1.x, 2.x) completion

### Error Handling Protocol
- If compilation or build errors occur, STOP immediately
- Request user intervention for blocking issues
- Never mock or fake solutions to move forward
- Ensure working functionality before proceeding

## Next Steps After Task Completion
1. Run full test suite to verify all functionality
2. Update implementation progress in PRD.md
3. Identify next feature for implementation (likely Phase 2.5: Interactions System)
4. Clean up task file once work is complete
