## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Schema Status:
âœ… **Already Created:**
- `likes` table with proper constraints and indexes
- `comments` table with threading support
- `follows` table with user relationships
- Proper foreign key constraints and cascade deletes

### API Endpoint Structure:
**Likes Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/likes` - Body: `{content_type: 'post'|'video', content_id: string}`
- `DELETE /api/likes` - Body: `{content_type: 'post'|'video', content_id: string}`
- `GET /api/likes/status?content_type=post&content_id=xxx` - Check like status

**Comments Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/comments` - Body: `{content_type, content_id, comment_text, parent_id?}`
- `GET /api/comments?content_type=post&content_id=xxx&limit=10&cursor=xxx`
- `PUT /api/comments/:id` - Body: `{comment_text}`
- `DELETE /api/comments/:id`

**Follows Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/follows` - Body: `{following_id: string}`
- `DELETE /api/follows` - Body: `{following_id: string}`
- `GET /api/follows/following?limit=10&cursor=xxx`
- `GET /api/follows/followers?limit=10&cursor=xxx`

### Integration Points:
1. **Unified Feed Integration**: Update feed endpoint to include user's like status and follow relationships
2. **Authentication Integration**: All endpoints require valid JWT authentication
3. **Real-time Integration**: Social interactions trigger real-time updates to connected clients
4. **Performance Integration**: Social interaction data cached and optimized for feed queries
