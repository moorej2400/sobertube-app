- [ ] 3.0.2 - Implement video processing and thumbnail generation  
- [ ] 3.0.3 - Add video metadata storage in database

### Feature 3.1 - Post Management System
- [ ] 3.1.0 - Create text post creation endpoint
- [ ] 3.1.1 - Implement post retrieval and feed endpoints
- [ ] 3.1.2 - Add post types (recovery update, milestone, inspiration, etc.)
- [ ] 3.1.3 - Implement post editing and deletion

### Feature 3.2 - Social Interactions
- [ ] 3.2.0 - Create likes system for videos and posts
- [ ] 3.2.1 - Implement comment system
- [ ] 3.2.2 - Add sharing functionality
- [ ] 3.2.3 - Create reporting system for inappropriate content

## Critical Instructions for Sub-Agents

### Environment Context
- Running in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Ubuntu
- ALWAYS use desktop commander MCP tools for docker and curl operations
- Working directory: /home/jared/dev/personal/sobertube-app
- Git repository is clean on master branch

### Development Guidelines
- Follow TDD methodology strictly - write tests first
- Only assign ONE sub-feature at a time to coder agents
- Run full test suite after each feature completion
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

### Database Schema Context
- Users table exists with username UNIQUE constraint
- Supabase Auth handles email/password authentication
- Custom users table stores profile data and enforces username uniqueness
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are in place

### Current Issue Details
The auth controller only uses Supabase Auth signup which stores username in metadata without checking the unique constraint in the users table. This allows duplicate usernames to be registered when they should return 409 Conflict status.

### Required Fix Implementation
1. Check username against users table BEFORE Supabase Auth signup
2. Use database transaction to ensure atomicity
3. Insert user record in users table AFTER successful Supabase Auth registration
4. Handle constraint violations and return proper 409 responses
5. Ensure test "should reject registration with duplicate username" passes

### Success Criteria for Phase 0
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New duplicate username test passes  
- [ ] No regression in authentication functionality
- [ ] Username uniqueness properly enforced across both Supabase Auth and users table
- [ ] Proper error handling for all edge cases

## Agent Assignment Strategy

### Phase 0 (Auth Fix) - CODER-AGENT
- Focus on backend TypeScript/Node.js development
- Database integration with Supabase  
- Test-driven development approach
- Error handling and validation

### Phase 1 (Analysis) - WORKER-AGENT  
- File system analysis and documentation review
- Status assessment and planning
- Non-coding research and analysis tasks

### Phase 2+ (Feature Development) - CODER-AGENT + WORKER-AGENT
- CODER-AGENT: Backend endpoints, database operations, tests
- WORKER-AGENT: System tasks, file operations, environment setup

### Validation Strategy
After each feature completion:
1. Launch VALIDATOR-AGENT to verify implementation  
2. Run full test suite
3. Check integration with existing functionality
4. Validate against acceptance criteria
5. Update task progress checkboxes
