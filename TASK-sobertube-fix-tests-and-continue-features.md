# TASK: SoberTube Fix Tests and Continue Feature Implementation

## Project Context
- **Repository**: /home/jared/dev/personal/sobertube-app
- **Environment**: WSL Ubuntu, Node.js/TypeScript backend with Supabase
- **Current Status**: Build system works (`npm run build` passes), but test system is broken
- **Critical Issue**: Tests cannot find module paths due to incorrect relative path imports

## Current System Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ WORKING SYSTEMS:
- Infrastructure Setup (Docker, Supabase)
- TypeScript compilation (npm run build passes)
- Backend Foundation (Express, middleware, error handling)
- Authentication System (code exists)
- User Profile System (code exists) 
- Posts System (code exists)

### ‚ùå BROKEN SYSTEMS:
- **Test System**: Path imports are incorrect in test files
- **Feature Validation**: Cannot verify if features work due to broken tests
- **Continuous Development**: Cannot proceed safely without working tests

### üîç IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
1. **Import Path Problems**: Tests use '../src/app' but should use '../../src/app' (from backend/tests/integration/)
2. **Test Configuration**: Jest config may need path mapping updates
3. **Unknown Feature Status**: Cannot validate which features are complete vs partial

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] **5.0.4**: Create detailed breakdown for chosen next feature

## Agent Assignment Strategy

### Phase 0 (Test Fixes): **CODER-AGENT**
- Import path fixes are code changes
- Test configuration updates are code changes
- Each sub-feature should be assigned to coder-agent individually

### Phase 1 (Validation): **WORKER-AGENT** 
- Running tests and collecting results
- Analyzing test output and documenting status
- No code changes, just analysis and reporting

### Phase 2-4 (Feature Completion): **CODER-AGENT**
- Missing feature implementation is code development
- Each sub-feature assigned individually to coder-agent
- Includes both implementation and test updates

### Phase 5 (Next Feature): **BREAKDOWN-AGENT ‚Üí CODER-AGENT**
- First breakdown-agent to plan next feature
- Then individual coder-agent assignments for implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Test System Requirements
- All import paths must be correct relative to file locations
- Jest configuration must support current directory structure
- Test environment must connect to test database properly
- All existing tests must pass before proceeding with new features

### Feature Validation Requirements
- Each system (auth, profile, posts) must have passing integration tests
- Database operations must be tested with real connections (no mocks)
- Authorization and authentication must be thoroughly tested
- Error scenarios must be properly tested and handled

### Implementation Standards
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage (‚â•80%)
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Follow TDD methodology for any new code
- Ensure proper error handling and logging

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 Complete When:
- [ ] All test files have correct import paths
- [ ] `npm test` runs without module resolution errors
- [ ] At least one simple test passes to prove system works
- [ ] Test environment connects to database successfully

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Complete test results analysis for all features
- [ ] Clear documentation of which features work vs need fixes
- [ ] Comprehensive status report of system implementation
- [ ] Ready to proceed with targeted fixes or next features

### Phase 2-4 Complete When:
- [ ] All authentication tests pass
- [ ] All profile tests pass  
- [ ] All posts tests pass
- [ ] Cross-system integration tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in any existing functionality

### Phase 5 Complete When:
- [ ] Next feature is identified and planned
- [ ] Implementation breakdown is created
- [ ] Ready to proceed with next development cycle

## Critical Notes

### Environment Requirements
- Running in WSL Ubuntu environment
- Must use desktop commander MCP for docker and curl operations
- Follow TDD methodology strictly
- Each sub-feature must be assigned to only ONE agent at a time

### Failure Recovery
- If any phase fails, STOP and report issues to user
- Do not proceed to next phase until current phase is 100% complete
- If tests reveal missing dependencies or infrastructure issues, address immediately

### Quality Assurance
- Every code change must have corresponding tests
- No changes should be made without test validation
- Build system must continue to work throughout all changes
- Database integrity must be maintained
