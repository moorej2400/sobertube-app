# TASK: Timeline/Feed System - Complete Follows API & Social Interactions

## CURRENT STATUS
- **Overall Progress**: 75% → Target: 90%+
- **Database Schemas**: ✅ Complete (Unified feed, likes, comments, follows)
- **Feed System**: ✅ Complete (Unified endpoint combining videos and posts)
- **Likes System**: ✅ Complete (Controller, API endpoints, testing)
- **Comments System**: ✅ Complete (Controller, CRUD endpoints, threading)  
- **Follows System**: ✅ Controller Complete, ❌ API Endpoints Needed

## PHASE 0: SYSTEM VERIFICATION
### Feature 0.0: Pre-Implementation Checks
- [ ] 0.0.0: Verify follows controller exists and is functional
- [ ] 0.0.1: Check existing route patterns from likes/comments for consistency
- [ ] 0.0.2: Verify authentication middleware is available for integration

## PHASE 1: FOLLOWS API ENDPOINTS IMPLEMENTATION
### Feature 1.0: Create Follows Routes File
- [ ] 1.0.0: Create backend/src/routes/follows.ts with proper TypeScript structure
- [ ] 1.0.1: Implement POST /api/follows route for following users
- [ ] 1.0.2: Implement DELETE /api/follows/:followedId route for unfollowing users
- [ ] 1.0.3: Implement GET /api/follows/followers route for getting user's followers
- [ ] 1.0.4: Implement GET /api/follows/following route for getting users being followed

### Feature 1.1: Middleware Integration
- [ ] 1.1.0: Add authentication middleware to all follows routes
- [ ] 1.1.1: Add rate limiting middleware to follows routes
- [ ] 1.1.2: Add input validation middleware for route parameters
- [ ] 1.1.3: Add error handling middleware consistent with other routes

### Feature 1.2: Main App Integration
- [ ] 1.2.0: Import follows routes in backend/src/app.ts
- [ ] 1.2.1: Register follows routes with Express app under /api/follows
- [ ] 1.2.2: Ensure follows routes are positioned correctly in middleware stack
- [ ] 1.2.3: Verify route registration with existing authentication flow

## PHASE 2: SOCIAL INTERACTIONS INTEGRATION
### Feature 2.0: Cross-System Integration Testing
- [ ] 2.0.0: Test follows system integration with existing authentication
- [ ] 2.0.1: Verify follows endpoints work with Supabase database functions
- [ ] 2.0.2: Test error handling consistency across all social interaction APIs
- [ ] 2.0.3: Validate follows system works with existing user profile system

### Feature 2.1: API Consistency Verification
- [ ] 2.1.0: Ensure follows API responses match likes/comments format
- [ ] 2.1.1: Verify HTTP status codes are consistent across social APIs
- [ ] 2.1.2: Check error message formats match existing patterns
- [ ] 2.1.3: Validate API documentation consistency requirements

## PHASE 3: SYSTEM COMPLETION
### Feature 3.0: Final Integration & Testing
- [ ] 3.0.0: Run comprehensive tests on all social interaction systems together
- [ ] 3.0.1: Verify Timeline/Feed System can utilize follows data
- [ ] 3.0.2: Test social interactions work seamlessly with feed generation
- [ ] 3.0.3: Validate system performance with integrated social features

### Feature 3.1: Documentation & Progress Update
- [ ] 3.1.0: Update system documentation with completed follows implementation
- [ ] 3.1.1: Update progress tracking from 75% to final completion percentage
- [ ] 3.1.2: Document API endpoints for follows system
- [ ] 3.1.3: Prepare status update for Timeline/Feed System completion

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
1. Follows API endpoints fully implemented and integrated
2. All social interaction systems (likes, comments, follows) working together
3. Timeline/Feed System progress advanced to 90%+ completion
4. Consistent API patterns across all social interaction endpoints
5. Proper authentication and middleware integration maintained
6. System ready for final feed personalization features

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Follow existing code patterns from likes/comments controllers
- Use TypeScript throughout implementation
- Maintain consistency with existing authentication middleware
- Follow TDD methodology where applicable
- Use desktop commander MCP tools for any docker/curl operations
- Integrate with existing Supabase database functions
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
