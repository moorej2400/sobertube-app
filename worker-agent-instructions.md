# Worker Agent Task: Update Task File with Current Status

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
You are operating as a WORKER-AGENT in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Ubuntu. 

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPERATIONS
- ALWAYS use desktop commander MCP tools for docker and curl operations
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## TASK OBJECTIVE
Update the existing TASK-timeline-feed-realtime-features.md file to reflect that the WebSocket infrastructure (Phase 1, Feature 1.0) has been completed and committed. Mark the appropriate checkboxes as completed and identify the next immediate sub-feature to work on.

## CURRENT STATUS CONTEXT
According to the orchestrator's instructions:

**✅ JUST COMPLETED & COMMITTED:**
- WebSocket infrastructure foundation with Socket.IO integration
- JWT-authenticated WebSocket connections with secure handshake
- Connection lifecycle management and user tracking
- Complete TypeScript implementation with comprehensive interfaces
- Express integration maintaining existing backend architecture
- All changes committed and pushed to repository

This means **ALL** of Phase 1, Feature 1.0 (WebSocket Server Infrastructure) is complete:
- ✅ Sub-feature 1.0.0: Set up WebSocket server with Socket.IO integration 
- ✅ Sub-feature 1.0.1: Authentication and Connection Management
- ✅ Sub-feature 1.0.2: Real-Time Event Framework

## SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Update TASK-timeline-feed-realtime-features.md file:**
   - Mark ALL checkboxes in Feature 1.0 as completed [x]
   - Add completion notes indicating "✅ COMPLETED & COMMITTED" for Feature 1.0
   - Identify the next logical sub-feature to work on (should be Feature 1.1, Sub-feature 1.1.0: Real-Time Likes System)

2. **Verify Task File Structure:**
   - Ensure the task file maintains its comprehensive structure
   - Preserve all future phases and features for continued orchestration
   - Maintain clear progress tracking for the orchestrator

3. **Next Sub-Feature Identification:**
   - Clearly identify that the next sub-feature is: "Sub-feature 1.1.0: Real-Time Likes System"
   - Ensure this sub-feature is ready for a CODER-AGENT to work on

## EXPECTED OUTCOME
The task file should be updated to show Feature 1.0 as completely done, with clear identification of the next sub-feature (1.1.0) that needs to be assigned to a CODER-AGENT for implementation.
