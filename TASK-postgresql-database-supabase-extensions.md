- Moderated: Content under review or restricted

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] RLS policies enforce existing privacy rules
- [ ] Follow-based access controls work correctly
- [ ] Role-based permissions maintain moderation capabilities
- [ ] JWT authentication integrates with RLS
- [ ] Performance impact minimal compared to current system
- [ ] All existing access patterns preserved

### 1.2.4 Add database seeding and fixture management
**Status**: [ ] Pending

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Execution Order:
1. **1.2.1** (Critical Path): Deploy PostgreSQL with extensions first
2. **1.2.2** (Critical Path): Implement schema migration system immediately after
3. **1.2.3** (High Priority): Configure RLS policies for security foundation
4. **1.2.4** & **1.2.5** (Parallel): Development tools can be implemented in parallel

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Data Preservation**: All migrations must preserve existing Timeline/Feed data
- **Performance Maintenance**: New system must meet or exceed current performance
- **Feature Flags**: Use gradual migration approach with feature toggles
- **Rollback Capability**: Every change must have tested rollback procedures
- **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each sub-feature completion

### Success Criteria for Phase 1.2:
- [ ] PostgreSQL database operational with all Supabase extensions
- [ ] Complete schema migration system independent of Supabase CLI
- [ ] RLS policies replacing custom authorization middleware
- [ ] Development environment with comprehensive test data
- [ ] Monitoring and debugging tools operational
- [ ] 95% Timeline/Feed System functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks
- [ ] All sub-features independently validated and tested

## Next Phase Preparation:
Upon successful completion of Phase 1.2, the system will be ready for Phase 1.3: Authentication Service (GoTrue) Setup, which will integrate with the RLS policies established in this phase.
