  - `DELETE /api/comments/:id` - Delete comments (owner only)

## Current Backend Architecture

### API Structure:
- **Routes**: `/api/auth`, `/api/profiles`, `/api/posts`, `/api/videos`, `/api/feed`, `/api/likes`, `/api/comments`
- **Controllers**: auth, profile, posts, videos, feed, likes, comments
- **Middleware**: authentication, error handling, logging, rate limiting
- **Services**: Supabase client, health checks

### Database Schema:
- **Core Tables**: users, posts, videos (existing)
- **Social Tables**: likes, comments, follows (complete)
- **Advanced Features**: 
  - Comment threading with parent-child relationships
  - Atomic like operations with count tracking
  - Content existence validation with triggers
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Testing Coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: All controllers with >95% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Full API endpoint testing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and edge cases
- **Authentication**: JWT flow testing
- **Database**: Transaction and constraint testing
