# WORKER AGENT TASK: Test System Comprehensive Validation (Phase 0.2)

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKER AGENT:
- You are running in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Ubuntu
- ALWAYS use desktop commander MCP tools for docker and curl operations
- Follow TDD methodology strictly
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## ASSIGNED SUB-FEATURE: 0.2 Test System Comprehensive Validation

### CURRENT STATUS:
âœ… **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Test system is now working!
- Import paths fixed
- Environment configuration working
- Tests running with correct database connection
- auth-registration.test.ts results: **13 passed, 6 failed**

### CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. **Database Constraint**: `"username_length"` constraint violations
2. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented (tests expect 429 responses)
3. **User Registration**: Failing due to database constraints

### SPECIFIC TASKS:
- [ ] **0.2.0**: Run all unit tests to ensure they pass
- [ ] **0.2.1**: Run all integration tests to verify database connections work
- [ ] **0.2.2**: Run auth-specific tests to validate authentication system
- [ ] **0.2.3**: Run profile tests to validate profile system
- [ ] **0.2.4**: Run posts tests to validate posts system (if implemented)

### TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
- Working directory: /home/jared/dev/personal/sobertube-app
- Backend directory: /home/jared/dev/personal/sobertube-app/backend
- Test system is now functional - focus on comprehensive analysis
- Need to identify which features work vs which need fixes

### TESTING APPROACH:
1. **Unit Tests Analysis**: Run and analyze unit test results
2. **Integration Tests Analysis**: Run various integration test suites 
3. **Feature-Specific Analysis**: Test auth, profile, posts separately
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive status report

### FILES TO TEST:
- Unit tests: backend/tests/unit/*.test.ts
- Integration tests: backend/tests/integration/*.test.ts
- Auth tests: auth-registration.test.ts, auth-login-logout.test.ts, auth-refresh-session.test.ts
- Profile tests: profile-*.test.ts
- Posts tests: posts-*.test.ts

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] Complete test results analysis for all test suites
- [ ] Clear identification of which features are working vs broken
- [ ] Documentation of specific issues that need fixing
- [ ] Percentage of tests passing per feature area
- [ ] Ready to proceed with targeted fixes in next phases

### ANALYSIS FOCUS:
This is **analysis and documentation work**, not code fixes. Goals:
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run all test suites systematically
2. **Results Analysis**: Document what works vs what doesn't
3. **Issue Categorization**: Group issues by type (database, validation, missing features)
4. **Priority Assessment**: Identify which issues are critical vs minor
5. **Feature Status**: Determine completion level of auth, profile, posts systems

### CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not attempt to fix any code issues found
- Focus solely on testing and analysis
- Document results clearly for next phase planning
- Ensure all test categories are covered
- Maintain detailed logs of test results

This phase determines the current state of all features so we can plan targeted fixes.
