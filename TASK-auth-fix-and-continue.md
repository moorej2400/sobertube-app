# TASK: Auth Fix and Continue Implementation

## Phase 0: Critical Auth Fix
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

### 0.0: Fix Username Uniqueness Validation
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

#### 0.0.0: Analyze Current Auth Implementation
- [x] Read current auth controller implementation
- [x] Identify the failing test case
- [x] Understand the current registration flow
- [x] Review database schema for users table

#### 0.0.1: Implement Username Uniqueness Check  
- [x] Add database query to check username uniqueness before Supabase signup
- [x] Return 409 Conflict if username already exists
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and response format

#### 0.0.2: Fix User Record Creation
- [x] Add user record insertion into users table after successful Supabase Auth signup
- [x] Handle database constraint errors properly
- [x] Ensure transactional behavior if possible

#### 0.0.3: Test and Verify Fix
- [x] Run specific failing test to ensure it passes
- [x] Run all auth-related tests to ensure no regressions
- [x] Verify both positive and negative test cases work

**‚úÖ RESULT: Username uniqueness validation is working correctly! The auth controller properly checks username uniqueness against the users table before Supabase Auth signup and returns appropriate 409 Conflict responses for duplicate usernames.**

**‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE TESTS CREATED:**
- Created posts-crud.test.ts with 25+ test cases covering all CRUD operations
- Tests include authentication, authorization, validation, error handling
- Covers pagination, filtering, and edge cases
- Tests follow TDD methodology with proper setup/cleanup

## Critical Instructions for All Agents

### Environment Context
- Running in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Ubuntu
- Working directory: /home/jared/dev/personal/sobertube-app
- Git status: Clean repository on master branch

### Mandatory Requirements
- ALWAYS use desktop commander MCP tools for docker and curl operations
- When launching coder agents, only assign ONE sub-feature at a time, never multiple features
- Follow TDD methodology strictly
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

### Agent Assignment Guidelines
- **CODER-AGENT**: Code writing, test writing, software development, debugging, refactoring
- **WORKER-AGENT**: Browser tasks, system administration, file management, data processing, research, documentation

### Progress Tracking
- ‚úÖ = Completed
- üîÑ = In Progress  
- ‚ùå = Pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Blocked/Issues

## Notes
- Each sub-feature (x.x.x) should be assigned to only one agent at a time
- Validator agent runs after each feature (x.x) completion
- Update checkboxes as work progresses
- This file will be deleted after all work is completed
